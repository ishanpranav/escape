# Escape from the Haunted Castle
This was my first programming project (circa 6th grade). I have been hesitating to release this project ever since, mostly because the code base is _horrendous_ and demands a total rewrite from the ground up. If you come across this project, please do not read the code! Or at least keep in mind it was written when I was first teaching myself how to code. This was long before I understood OOP or anything else in computer science.
