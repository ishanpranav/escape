# Escape from the Haunted Castle
This was my first programming project (circa 6th grade). I have been hesitating to release this project ever since, mostly because the code base is _horrendous_ and demands a total rewrite from the ground up. If you come across this project, please do not read the code! Or at least keep in mind it was written when I was first teaching myself how to code. This was long before I understood OOP or anything else in computer science.

You can play the game [here](https://ishanpranav.github.io/escape/).

Unfortunately, I have lost the manual... Also, the registration feature makes no sense, so I removed it. There is one section called "Important code - do not edit." However, I strongly feel that this code is not correct. Still, I am too afraid to disagree with my past self and change it. Finally, I am responsible for my capitalization choices.

I have included the [high scores](HISCORES.DAT) as well as the [walkthrough](WALKTHRU.txt). Please contact me at [ishan.pranav@stern.nyu.edu](mailto:ishan.pranav@stern.nyu.edu) if you would like to be included in the global high scores leaderboard (you are not allowed to use the code or the walkthrough).
